== Description ==

NewsletterGate helps you gate/restrict content for your newsletter subscribers.

If you have an email list, you can reward subscribers from your list with special content.

So how can NewsletterGate help you?

1. Add your newsletter API keys (currently, MailChimp)
2. Copy the prepared shortcode for your desired list
3. Wrap the content you want to gate
4. Decide to allow people to subscribe from the page or not.

This plugin is perfect if:

1. you don't want a payment system on your WordPress site,
2. you have a store elsewhere that adds customers to your email list
